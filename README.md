    Project name: Car price calculator. 
    
    Short description:
    Our project is made with the purpose of helping people get a fair valuation of their used car via using data from known car sales websites.
    The idea is to let the user enter his details about his car and he'll receive a rough estimate of what we believe to be the correct price based on our data and
    present him with both the estimate but also the plot showing our data so the know on how much data we based our answer on giving them clear insight into the process.
    
    
    List of used technologies:
    
    Installation guide (if any libraries need to be installed):
    No libraries installation is needed, just run the server.py and interact with the endpoints. 
    
    
    User guide (how to run the program):
    
    Status (What has been done (and if anything: what was not done)):
    
    List of Challenges you have set up for your self (The things in your project you want to highlight):





    The project purpose is to start the car portal where users can add their cars to be sold on the portal. The concept is to use Machine Learning to help the user sell the car with the highest profit. 

    System will use data from bilbasen, DBA, guloggratis or other portals to train the model and will use the user input as input data.

    The main focus is on the backend of the system.

    The API

        scraping data from listed portals

        data engineering 

        learning the model to predict the price the car can be sold for

        user input validation 

        data visualisation :  visualize the data about chosen cars out of chosen features

    Vi sender det først nu da vi havde planlagt vores arbejde ud fra det du sagde til undervisning - at vi skal sende det senest mandag. Vi ved ikke om beskrivelsen er detaljeret nok, så du må gerne give feedback hvis vi skal beskrive det anderledes .
