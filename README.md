    Project name: Car price calculator. 
    
    Short description:
    Our project is made with the purpose of helping people get a fair valuation of their used car via using data from known car sales websites.
    The idea is to let the user enter his details about his car and he'll receive a rough estimate of what we believe to be the correct price based on our data and
    present him with both the estimate but also the plot showing our data so the know on how much data we based our answer on giving them clear insight into the process.
